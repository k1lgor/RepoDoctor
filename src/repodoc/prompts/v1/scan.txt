You are performing a comprehensive repository health scan.

TASK:
Execute a full multi-module repository health scan by running these analyses in sequence:
1. Diet analysis (bloat and hygiene)
2. Tour generation (onboarding guide)
3. Docker analysis (Dockerfile optimization)
4. Dead code detection (unused code heuristics)

Then aggregate the results into a comprehensive health report.

IMPORTANT:
This prompt should typically NOT be used directly. Instead, the RepoDoctor CLI will:
- Run each module (diet, tour, docker, deadcode) separately
- Aggregate the results programmatically
- Calculate an overall health score
- Generate a consolidated report

If you ARE running this as a single invocation, perform all four analyses and aggregate them.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return STRICT JSON with aggregated results:

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Overall score: 0-100 (weighted average of module scores)
- Grade: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (<60)
- Module scores based on issues found and their severity
- Favor actionable findings over minor nitpicks

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY the JSON, nothing else
- Ensure all module results are included
- Calculate health score based on findings
- Prioritize issues by severity and impact
